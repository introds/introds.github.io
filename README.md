Introduction to Data Science 2018 (miniproject)

Ideas from Kaggle site:
- What areas of the country are most likely to have UFO sightings?
- Are there any trends in UFO sightings over time? Do they tend to be clustered or seasonal?
- Do clusters of UFO sightings correlate with landmarks, such as airports or government research centers?
- What are the most common UFO descriptions?

New idea:
- Add weather, population... about the sight?
- Military base, airport near the sight?
-
